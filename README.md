Version 2 updates:

1. Extend the functionalities based on version 1. Add Decision Tree, SVM, KNN recommendation algorithm based on Machine
Learning Idea.
2. Add new data set
3. Add new report and explain the whole algorithm more detailedly

Below is version one's description

Abstraction:
	The target of the project is help people, especially new graduates find
	jobs best fit them. We use data science and machine learning techniques
	to realize this target. The result is demostrated in Ipythnote book,
	feel free to contact me if you are interested in this project. My email
	is lei.yang.cs.art@gmail.com

Data Set:
	For this project, we collect data of various hiring information from
	indeed.com, from 2014 - 2016, and filter out jobs located in Massachusetts.

Techniques:
We use various cluster techniques, including K-Means++ and
Hierarchical, to classify information based on job categories
and locations to get the industrial distribution in Massachusetts. 

After that, we use different regression methods to find out what are the
main factors that influence the rating of a job. Therefore, when a user
gives us a particular kind of job that he/she is looking for, this
program can recommend the user where is the good place to find such a
job. Besides, when a user gives us a job post he is interested in but
with very few reviews, we can predict whether it is a good job or not
based on our big data history.

Also, we use a series of visualization techniques to visualize the our
findings. Find them in our program!
